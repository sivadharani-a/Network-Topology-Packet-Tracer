ðŸš€ Basic Network Topology Design Using Cisco Packet Tracer


ðŸ“š Project Description

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a simple computer network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It involves two PCs connected through switches and a router, enabling communication across two different subnets.

ðŸ›  Devices Used

- 1 Ã— Router (Cisco 1941 or 2911)
- 2 Ã— Switches (Cisco 2960)
- 2 Ã— PCs
- Copper Straight-Through Cables


ðŸŒŸ Learning Outcomes

- Basic understanding of LAN design
- Practical experience with Cisco Packet Tracer
- Router and PC interface configuration
- Network communication verification using ICMP (ping)


ðŸš§ Future Enhancements

- Add a web server to simulate HTTP access
- Implement VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing
- Expand the topology with dynamic routing protocols like RIP or OSPF
